Scenario: Merge maneuver from overtake (testing algorithm adjustment)
Goal: Avoid cutting line which intersect the x-axis behaind the robot in two.  
Solution: If the absolute different between the first and last x in the scan 
is small (< 0.01), then we assume that the points are contiguous (i.e., intersects x-axis).
Result: This issue have been addressed, however needs further testing to be sure.
